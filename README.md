# Fun-Reddit-Bot
 This is a repo for a collection of Reddit bots I am making using [PRAW library](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

 All code needs login info which is found in a file named <code>SecretStuff.txt</code> (not included in repo)
* see example SecretStuff file to see format

## List of bots:

### <code>SubredditNotificationBot</code>
* Bot that will periodically check new posts of a subreddit then notify your desktop if any of the entered keywords are present in the post title
* Searched subreddit and search terms can be changed in code of program (this will change later)

### <code>EmpacherIdentificationBot</code>
* This bot will periodically check for new image posts on r/Rowing and analyze the image for an Empacher
